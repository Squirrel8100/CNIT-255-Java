This repository is meant as a personal reference to the projects and assignments completed throughout my undergrad. 
These are NOT and should NOT be referenced if you are a current purdue student learning the same or similar material. 
It will NOT help you understand the material nor get a better grade on your labs as I cannot vouch for the working/propriety of my code.
